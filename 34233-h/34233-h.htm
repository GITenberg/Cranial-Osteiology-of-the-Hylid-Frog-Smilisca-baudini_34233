<p>The paucity of descriptive cranial anatomical work dealing with
hylid frogs was pointed out by Trueb (1966) in her paper describing
the cranial osteology of <i>Hyla septentrionalis</i>. Comparative
studies on the cranial osteology of the genus <i>Smilisca</i> (Duellman
and Trueb, 1966), along with other more brief descriptions, reveal
variation among cranial characters of hylids. Since these external
characters have been useful in defining species, species groups, and
genera, it seems worthwhile to pursue correlated studies on internal
cranial structure. The following account dealing with the Neotropical
tree frog, <i>Smilisca baudini</i> Duméril and Bibron, 1841, is
the first published description of the internal cranial anatomy of
a hylid frog, and supplements the recent account (Duellman and
Trueb, 1966) of external cranial osteology of the same species.
Comparative studies of hylid skulls are expected to yield information
of taxonomic importance.</p>

<p>I am grateful to Richard J. Baldauf of Texas A &amp; M University
and William E. Duellman of the University of Kansas for critically
reading the manuscript and offering helpful suggestions. The findings
reported here result from research on Middle American hylids
supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (GB-1441)
to William E. Duellman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="caption3">Materials and Methods</div>

<p>The serial sections illustrated beyond are from an adult male of
<i>Smilisca baudini</i> (KU 89924) having a snout-vent length of 53.0
mm. and a head width (measured at angle of jaws) of 17.0 mm.
The specimen was collected 5.2 kilometers east-southeast of Córdoba,
Veracruz, México. Transverse sections were cut at thicknesses
of 10 and 15 microns on a rotary microtome and stained
according to the technique described by Baldauf (1958). Cleared
and stained specimens and dried skeletons also were used. <a href="#Fig_1">Figure
1</a> is based on KU 68183-4 and <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a> on KU 55614. All other drawings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
are made from KU 89924. In all cross-sectional figures, bone
is represented by solid black, cartilage by stippling, and connective
tissue by cross-hatching. Unless otherwise noted all descriptions
are given in an anterior-posterior sequence.</p>

<p>Commonly accepted English terms are used. For example, dentary
is used in preference to dentale and maxillary process instead
of processus maxillaris. If no commonly accepted English term is
available for a given structure, the Latin name is retained. For
example, the cartilaginous plate separating the cavum principale
from the cavum medium is termed the lamina superior.</p>

<p><i>Alary cartilage.</i>&mdash;The anterior end of the alary cartilage (<i>al. c.</i>,
<a href="#Fig_2_5">Figs.&nbsp;2-5</a>) lies within the posterior concavity of the alary process
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
(<i>al. proc.</i>, <a href="#Fig_1">Figs. 1-3</a>) of the premaxillary (<i>pmax.</i>). In posterior
sections the cartilage assumes a dorsolateral position (<a href="#Fig_2_5">Fig. 3</a>),
ventral and slightly lateral to the tectum nasi. The alary cartilage
remains narrowly separated from the tectum nasi but fuses ventromedially
with the septum nasi and forms a nearly complete cartilaginous
capsule around the anterior end of the cavum principale.
Posterior to the anterior end of the cavum medium and the lamina
superior, the alary cartilage separates ventrally from the lamina.
In subsequent posterior sections, the cartilage, arcuate in cross
section, becomes progressively smaller and terminates at the level
of the union of the medial and lateral recesses of the cavum inferior.</p>

<p><i>Prenasal cartilages.</i>&mdash;The superior prenasal cartilage is small; it
lies adjacent to the posterodorsal surface of the alary process of
the premaxillary, and anterior to the alary cartilage. The inferior
prenasal cartilage (<i>inf. pnas. c.</i>, <a href="#Fig_2_5">Figs. 2-6</a>, <a href="#Fig_8">and 8</a>) appears posterior
to the appearance of the alary cartilage. The anterior terminus
lies at the base of the alary process; the cartilage extends dorsally
(<a href="#Fig_2_5">Fig. 3</a>) along the posterior surface of the alary process and then
curves posterodorsally and joins the solum nasi medioventral to the
posterior end of the septomaxillary (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8d</a>).</p>

<p><i>Tectum nasi.</i>&mdash;The anterolateral corner of the tectum nasi (<i>tect.
nas.</i>, <a href="#Fig_2_5">Fig. 2</a>) appears just posterior and dorsomedial to the anterior
end of the alary cartilage. The anterior process is short; it fuses
medially with the septum nasi forming a complete roof to the
cavum principale (<a href="#Fig_2_5">Figs. 3 and 4</a>). The oblique cartilage (<i>obl. c.</i>)
diverges laterally from the tectum nasi just posterior to the terminus
of the alary cartilage (<a href="#Fig_6_7">Fig. 6</a>). Medially, the tectum nasi persists,
overlaid by the nasal bone laterally.</p>

<p><i>Septum nasi.</i>&mdash;Posterior to the appearance of the septum nasi
(<i>sept, nas.</i>) and its union with the tectum nasi (<a href="#Fig_2_5">Fig. 3</a>), the septum
abruptly expands across the width of the skull medial to the alary
cartilage. The septum is entirely cartilaginous posterior to the level
of the olfactory eminence, except for a small amount of secondary
membranous ossification dorsomedially at a level anterior to the
nasal bones. Perichondral ossification commences in the dorsal part
of the septum nasi at the level of the olfactory eminence. Endochondral
ossification first appears dorsally in the vertical part of
the septum at the level of the internal nares. Ossification of dorsal
parts of the septum precedes ossification of ventral parts. Perichondral
ossification of the ventral part of the septum nasi is first
noted at the level of transition between the planum antorbitale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
and solum nasi. Perichondral ossification gradually gives way to
endochondral ossification posteriorly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Nasal cavities and associated structures.</i>&mdash;The cavum principale
(<i>cav. prin.</i>, <a href="#Fig_2_5">Fig. 4</a>) is the most anterior of the nasal cavities. It
first appears within the capsule bordered dorsally by the tectum
nasi, medially and ventrally by the septum nasi, and laterally by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
the alary cartilage. The cavity extends posteriorly within recesses
of the sphenethmoid to the level at which the septum nasi terminates.</p>

<p>The cavum medium (<i>cav. med.</i>, <a href="#Fig_2_5">Fig. 5</a>) lies ventral and slightly
posterior to the anterior end of the cavum principale. It appears
slightly anterior to the septomaxillary at the level of the foramen
ramus externus narium and ramus medialis narium. The appearance
of the cavum medium within the ventrolateral extension of
the septum nasi divides the latter into an upper component, the
lamina superior (<i>l. sup.</i>) lying between the cavum principale and
cavum medium, and a lower part, the lamina inferior (<i>l. inf.</i>) lying
ventral to the cavum medium. As the cavum medium increases in
width in posterior sections, the lamina superior and lamina inferior
lose their lateral connection. The lateral part of the cavum medium
diverges in the region of the external nares as the nasolacrimal duct
(<i>ncl. dt.</i>) and the cavum medium becomes confluent with the
cavum principale (<a href="#Fig_6_7">Fig. 6</a>). The posterior end of the cavum medium
lies at the level of the posterior terminus of the septomaxillary.</p>

<p>Slightly posterior to the anterior end of the cavum medium the
foramen for the ramus externus narium (<i>r. ext. n. f.</i>) and ramus
medialis narium (<i>r. med. n. f.</i>) opens ventromedially into the floor
of the septum nasi (<a href="#Fig_2_5">Fig. 4</a>). The ventral closure of the floor of
the foramen completes the solum nasi, marks the anterior end of
the recessus medialis of the cavum inferior, and differentiates the
roof of the recess, the crista intermedia (<i>cr. int.</i>), from the solum
(<a href="#Fig_2_5">Fig. 5</a>). The crista intermedia joins the laminae superior and
inferior and joins them for a short distance to the septum nasi
medially. The anterolateral part of the cavum inferior (<i>cav. inf.</i>)
lies ventrolateral to the cavum medium, and extends medially to
join the medial recess. The fusion of the two recesses of the cavum
inferior completely separates the lamina inferior from the solum
nasi (<a href="#Fig_6_7">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p>Near the level of the union of the recessus lateralis and recessus
medialis of the cavum inferior, the crista intermedia separates from
the septum nasi, and the lamina superior diverges at its mid-width
to accommodate the septomaxillary (<i>spmax.</i>) (<a href="#Fig_2_5">Figs. 5</a> <a href="#Fig_6_7">6</a>). The
lateral remnant of the lamina superior and transition zone between
the lamina superior and lamina inferior is short and is quickly
replaced by connective tissue. Slightly posterior, the distal edge
of the lamina inferior diverges laterally as a small process, which
lies dorsal to the pars facialis (<i>p. fac.</i>) of the maxillary. This part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
of the lamina inferior terminates posteriorly at the level of confluence
between the cavum principale and lateral recess of the cavum
inferior.</p>

<p>Slightly posterior to the divergence of the crista intermedia from
the septum nasi, the crista terminates, thereby separating the lamina
superior and the lamina inferior from one another (<a href="#Fig_6_7">Figs. 6</a> <a href="#Fig_8">and 8</a>).
The lamina superior terminates at the level of the infundibulum
(<i>inf.</i>, <a href="#Fig_6_7">Fig. 7</a>), whereas the lamina inferior extends posterolaterally,
increases greatly in depth and joins the laterally ascending oblique
cartilage (<i>obl. c.</i>) to form the planum terminale (<i>pla. ter.</i>, <a href="#Fig_10_11">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>The crista subnasalis (<i>cr. sub.</i>, <a href="#Fig_6_7">Fig. 6</a>) differentiates from the
lateral edge of solum nasi adjacent to the maxillary in sections just
posterior to the confluence of the recessus medialis and the recessus
lateralis. The crista persists as a rod of cartilage which gradually
diminishes in size and terminates at the posterior level of the septomaxillary.</p>

<p><i>The septomaxillary.</i>&mdash;The septomaxillary (<i>spmax.</i>, <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9a-c</a>) is a
triradiate bone. The anterior terminus is a thin sliver of bone oriented
horizontally between the cavum principale and cavum medium
and lateral to the lamina superior (<a href="#Fig_2_5">Figs. 5</a> <a href="#Fig_2_5">and 8a</a>). This
anterior ramus of the septomaxillary increases in size posteriorly and
diverges medially into a medial ramus (<i>med. r. spmax.</i>) and lateral
ramus (<i>lat. r. spmax.</i>, <a href="#Fig_2_5">Fig. 9a-b</a>) to accommodate the confluence
of the cavum principale and cavum medium (<a href="#Fig_2_5">Figs. 6</a> <a href="#Fig_8">and 8b-c</a>).
The small medial ramus is associated with the distal end of the
lamina superior whereas the lateral ramus lies dorsal to the lateral
margin of the cavum medium. Just anterior to the anterior end of
the nasolacrimal duct, the ventral ramus of the septomaxillary (<i>vent.
r. spmax.</i>, <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9c</a>) is present in cross-sections ventral to the cavum
medium. The ventral ramus joins the horizontal and dorsal rami
of the septomaxillary at the anterior end of the nasolacrimal duct.
The medial branch terminates posteriorly at the level at which the
cavum principale joins the cavum inferior. The lateral ramus of
the septomaxillary terminates posteriorly at the level at which the
recessus medialis diverges from the recessus lateralis posteriorly and
cavum principale and recessus lateralis are confluent.</p>

<p><i>Planum terminale.</i>&mdash;Posterior to the infundibulum the lamina
inferior and oblique cartilage join to form the planum terminale
(<i>pla. term.</i>) which lies lateral to the cavum principale (<a href="#Fig_10_11">Fig. 10</a>).
The lamina inferior diverges ventrally from the planum terminale
anterior to the olfactory eminence. The planum terminale is restricted
ventrally and terminates at the level of the olfactory eminence
(<i>olf. em.</i>, <a href="#Fig_10_11">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p><i>Anterior and posterior maxillary processes.</i>&mdash;The anterior end of
the anterior maxillary process (<i>ant. max. proc.</i>) lies within the
maxillary at the level of the posterior terminus of the planum
terminale. The anterior maxillary process diverges medially from
the maxillary (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>) and expands dorsally along the medial face
of the pars facialis to meet the planum antorbitale just anterior to
the transition zone between the latter and the solum nasi. Posterior
to the transition zone, the planum antorbitale disappears and the
posterior maxillary process is restricted ventrally along the pars
facialis of the maxillary. Posteriorly the cartilage is associated with
the pterygoid, where it is known as the pterygoid process (<i>pter.

just posterior to the incorporation of the inferior prenasal cartilage
into the solum (<a href="#Fig_6_7">Fig. 7</a>). The prevomer expands dorsally around
the distal end of the solum to provide a bony lateral support for the
olfactory eminence (<a href="#Fig_10_11">Figs. 10 and 11</a>). A distal wing of the prevomer
forms the bony anterior and medial margins of the internal

<div class="caption3">Sphenethmoid Region</div>

<p>Posterior to the transition zone between the planum antorbitale
and solum nasi, the sphenethmoid (<i>spheth.</i>, <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>) is fully ossified
medially, the lateral parts of the bone at this level are only ossified
perichondrally. The septum nasi persists at the anterior level of
the orbit and terminates just anterior to the orbitonasal foramen
(<i>orbnas. f.</i>) and the anterior end of the parasphenoid (<i>pasph.</i>,
<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>). The orbitonasal foramen is moderately large, has a complete
bony margin, and is located at the dorsolateral corner of the
braincase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span></p>

<p>At the level of the orbitonasal foramen, the sphenethmoid is
entirely ossified except for a small dorsolateral extension. This
distal extension expands laterally in posterior sections as the braincase
is increased to its maximum width at the mid-length of the
orbit; the cartilaginous margin is retained throughout the length
of the sphenethmoid.</p>

<p>The bony dorsomedial part of the sphenethmoid diverges, forming
the anterior border of the frontoparietal fontanelle (<i>fpar. fon.</i>,
<a href="#Fig_1">Figs. 1</a> <a href="#Fig_14_15">and 14</a>). The entire fontanelle is covered with a layer of
dense connective tissue continuous with that in which marginal
bones and cartilage of the sphenethmoid lie, and which is discrete
from the lower dermal layer of the overlying skin. At this level the
braincase is U-shaped in cross-section. Ossification terminates first
in the ventrolateral corners, followed by the lateral and dorsolateral
areas. The bony support of the latter area is furnished by the
lamina perpendicularis (<i>lam. perp.</i>) of the frontoparietal (<i>fpar.</i>,
<a href="#Fig_14_15">Fig. 14</a>). Cartilage appears in the ventral part of the sphenethmoid
in posteromost sections; at the posterior levels of the orbit the
sphenethmoid is entirely cartilaginous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="caption3">Orbital, Otic, and Occipital Regions</div>

<p><i>Orbital region.</i>&mdash;The sclera (<i>scl.</i>, <a href="#Fig_14_15">Fig. 14</a>) of the eye is cartilaginous.
The optic foramen (<i>opt. f.</i>) is large and lies in connective
tissue at the posterior limits of the orbit and sphenethmoid. At
the posterior levels of the foramen the dorsolateral cranial roof
cartilages, taeniatectí marginales (<i>t. t. mar.</i>) converge medially
to form the posterior margin of the frontoparietal fontanelle and
the tectum synoticum (<i>tect. syn.</i>) of the occipital region. At the
posterior levels of the orbit the bursa angularis oris (<i>b. ang. o.</i>,
<a href="#Fig_14_15">Fig. 14</a>) is present adjacent to the maxillary.</p>

<p><i>Nerve foramina of otic and occipital regions.</i>&mdash;The trochlear foramen
lies within the bony margins of the optic foramen. The trochlear
nerve is located posterodorsal to the optic tract, and separated from
the latter by connective tissue. The oculomotor foramen (<i>ocul. f.</i>)
lies in connective tissue posterior and ventral to the optic foramen
(<a href="#Fig_14_15">Fig. 15</a>). Anteriorly, dorsally, and ventrally the foramen has a
bony margin formed by the prootic (<i>pro.</i>); posteriorly, only a thin
layer of connective tissue separates the oculomotor from the large
prootic foramen (<i>pro. f.</i>). The latter is bordered by bone dorsally
and by cartilage ventrally (<a href="#Fig_16_17">Fig. 16</a>). Posteriorly, bone separates
the prootic foramen from the anterior acoustic foramen (<i>ant. acus.
f.</i>), through which the ramus acusticus anterior and medius pass
(<a href="#Fig_16_17">Fig. 17</a>). An extremely narrow bridge of cartilage separates the
anterior acoustic foramen from the larger posterior acoustic foramen
(<i>post. acus. f.</i>). The latter has a bony posterior margin and is
widely separated from the bony jugular foramen (<i>jug. f.</i>) posteriorly
(<a href="#Fig_18_19">Fig. 19</a>).</p>

<p><i>Pterygoid.</i>&mdash;The anterior terminus of the pterygoid (<i>pter.</i>, <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>)
appears at approximately the mid-length of the orbit as a small
arcuate bone closely applied to the posterior maxillary process.
Farther posteriorly the maxillary decreases in size, and the pterygoid
and posterior maxillary process diverge medially from it.
Posterior to this point of divergence, the posterior maxillary process
is known as the pterygoid process (<i>pter. proc.</i>). The anterior terminus
of the quadratojugal (<i>qj.</i>) lies medial to the maxillary at the
level of the oculomotor foramen (<a href="#Fig_14_15">Fig. 14</a>).</p>

<p><i>Otic region.</i>&mdash;The anterior end of the otic capsule (<i>ot. cap.</i>) is
present at the anterior level of the oculomotor foramen. The anterior
terminus of the pseudobasal process (<i>psdbas. proc.</i>) lies
within the medial portion of the pterygoid at the posterior border
of the oculomotor foramen (<a href="#Fig_14_15">Fig. 15</a>). The pseudobasal process
abruptly increases in size. At the level of the prootic foramen
(<a href="#Fig_16_17">Fig. 16</a>) the medial branch of the pterygoid diverges from the
posterior ramus and is closely applied to the medial surface of the
pseudobasal process. The otic process extends along the medial
surface of the squamosal from the dorsolateral edge of the pseudobasal
process, and then expands medially to meet the bony edge
of the otic capsule and form the crista parotica. Posterior to the
formation of the crista parotica, the ventral part of the otic process
splits. The medial part forms the ventrolateral ledge of the otic
capsule (<i>vl. l. ot. c.</i>, <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20a-f</a>), whereas the lateral part moves
ventrad in association with the ventral arm of the squamosal and
fuses with the pterygoid process posteriorly.</p>

<p>Posterior to the bony closure of the prootic foramen, the ventromedial
part of the pseudobasal process joins the prootic and forms
the ventrolateral edge of the otic capsule. The posterior terminus
of the medial branch of the pterygoid lies ventral to the lateral part
of the otic capsule. The posterior branch of the otic process merges
with the pterygoid process ventrally.</p>

<p>At the level of the anterior acoustic foramen the cornu principalis
of the hyale (<i>corn. prin.</i>) appears as a lateral ledge at the ventrolateral
corner of the otic capsule (<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20a-b</a>). The cornu principalis
diverges from the ledge at the level of the abbreviated bridge
between the anterior and posterior acoustic foramina. In posterior
sections the cornu lies medial to the squamosal-pterygoid process-pterygoid
complex (<a href="#Fig_18_19">Fig. 18</a>). The posterior terminus of the cornu
lies at a level with that of the posterior acoustic foramen.</p>

<p>The pars externa plectri (<i>p. ext. pl.</i>, <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20a-b</a>) is cartilaginous
and first appears dorsal to the ventral arm of the squamosal in
association with the tympanic membrane. The pars externa plectri
expands dorsomedially and is fused briefly to the crista parotica by
the pars ascendens plectri (<i>p. asc. pl.</i>, <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20b</a>). The pars interna
plectri (<i>p. int. pl.</i>, <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20b-f</a>) is cartilaginous and appears medial
to the pars media plectri and the ventrolateral ledge of the otic
capsule at the level of the anterior acoustic foramen. The pars
media plectri (<i>p. med. pl.</i>, <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20b-f</a>), a cartilage and bone element,
appears proximally at the dorsolateral edge of the otic capsule
and distally, ventral to the squamosal at a level between the
anterior and posterior acoustic foramina. At the level of the posterior
acoustic foramina the pars media plectri is bony, greatly
expanded in size, and joined to the pars interna plectri medially.</p>

<p>The operculum (<i>op.</i>, <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20d-h</a>) is cartilaginous and lies medial
to the lateral edge of the otic capsule between the pars interna
plectri and pars media plectri. The anterior end of the operculum
(<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20d</a>) lies at a level corresponding to the posterior part of
the posterior acoustic foramen. Posteriorly the operculum increases
in size, and the pars interna plectri and pars media plectri are
reduced (<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20e-f</a>). At a level corresponding to the posterior
border of the posterior acoustic foramen the medial portion of the
pars interna plectri disappears and leaves a small lateral rod of
cartilage surrounded on all but the ventral side by the operculum
(<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20f</a>). The operculum expands medially to merge with the
main part of the otic capsule (<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20g</a>). The lateral edge of the
operculum expands ventrally and then dorsomedially to form a
complete tube. Slightly more posteriorly the cartilaginous lateral
edge of the otic capsule, lateral to the operculum, dissipates into
connective tissue and finally disappears, leaving the posterior end
of the operculum as the most distal element of the otic capsule
(<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20h</a>).</p>

<p><i>Ossification in otic and occipital regions.</i>&mdash;The otic region of the
cranium is largely unossified. At the level of the optic foramen
(<a href="#Fig_14_15">Fig. 14</a>) the floor of the neurocranium is cartilaginous but completely
underlaid by the bony parasphenoid. The taenia tecti
marginales and the tectum synoticum are covered dorsally and
laterally by the frontoparietals. Perichondral ossification representing
the prootic bone occurs at the margin of the optic foramen and
somewhat posteriorly over part of the floor of the neurocranium.
Perichondral and endochondral ossification occurs in the sides of the
neurocranium ventral to the lamina perpendicularis. This ossification
expands laterally until it meets the crista parotica dorsolaterally
and forms the dorsal part of the prootic bone. The anteroventral
edge of the otic capsule remains cartilaginous. Posteriorly, at the
level of the anterior acoustic foramen, endochondral ossification is
meager and restricted to the dorsomedial parts of the otic capsule,
plus a small amount in the neurocranial floor; perichondral ossification
is restricted to the peripheral areas showing endochondral
ossification. Posteriorly, endochondral ossification is restricted in
the dorsal part of the otic capsule but somewhat increased in the
floor of the capsule. The lateral part of the otic capsule posterior
to the terminus of the operculum and the ventromedial and dorsomedial
parts of the neurocranium remain unossified.</p>

is dorsal to the angulosplenial. The cartilage increases in size
at the level of the posterior acoustic foramen, and the angulosplenial
decreases in size posteriorly. At the level of the posterior border
of the posterior acoustic foramen, the maxillary terminates and is
replaced by the quadratojugal. The quadratojugal, ventral arm of
the squamosal, pterygoid process, pterygoid, and Meckel's cartilage
converge. At the level of the jugular foramen (<i>jug. f.</i>) (<a href="#Fig_18_19">Fig. 19</a>)
the quadratojugal is incorporated into the squamosal-pterygoid
process-pterygoid complex. The complex is narrowly separated by
connective tissue from Meckel's cartilage ventrally. The quadrate
process (<i>quad. proc.</i>) is represented by the cartilage bordered
dorsally by the pterygoid process and the ventral arm of the squamosal,
and ventrally by Meckel's cartilage. At the posterior terminus
of the skull all bony elements of the articular region terminate,
except for a small terminal part of the angulosplenial underlying
Meckel's cartilage.</p>

<div class="caption2">SUMMARY</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since no accounts comparable to the preceding for <i>Smilisca
baudini</i> are available for other hylid frogs, it is meaningless to
attempt any discussion dealing with character significance or variation
within the Hylidae. There is considerable literature treating
bufonids, leptodactylids, ranids, and various Old World genera
(see Baldauf, 1955, for a review of these works). Likewise, a
comparison at the familial level based on the study of a single
species seems inadequate and premature. By way of summary and
synoptic description a list of cranial osteological characters of
<i>Smilisca baudini</i> is presented. The items selected enable comparison
with similar compilations by other workers, and are based in
part on my unpublished observations of other hylids.</p>

<div class="ind2em">&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Compared to hylids not having integumentary-cranial co-ossification, the dermal roofing bones of <i>Smilisca baudini</i> are extensive, and the skull is well-ossified internally. In contrast to most casque-headed hylids (those having integumentary-cranial co-ossification), the dermal roofing bones are much less extensive, the dermal sphenethmoid (see Trueb, 1966, p. 563) is absent, and internal ossification is less extensive.</div>

<div class="ind2em">&nbsp;2.&nbsp;The solum nasi is not ossified; the septum nasi is ossified only posteriorly, and the olfactory eminence is supported by the cartilaginous solum nasi and the bony prevomer.</div>

<div class="ind2em">&nbsp;3.&nbsp;The lingual process is absent. There is no palatal cartilage
isolated between the premaxillaries.</div>

<div class="ind2em">&nbsp;4.&nbsp;The anterior end of the cavum medium lies anterior to the
cavum inferius.</div>

<div class="ind2em">&nbsp;5.&nbsp;The septomaxillary is basically a U-shaped structure and has a dorsal, anteriorly curved, ramus on the lateral branch and a longitudinal loop of bone ventrally.</div>

<div class="ind2em">&nbsp;6.&nbsp;A distinct pars nasalis is absent on the maxillary.</div>

<div class="ind2em">&nbsp;7.&nbsp;A cartilaginous sclera is present.</div>

<div class="ind2em">&nbsp;8.&nbsp;The taenia tecta marginalis and the tectum synoticum are the only roofing cartilages present.</div>

<div class="ind2em">&nbsp;9.&nbsp;The external part of the plectral apparatus (columella) is directed anterolaterally. The pars ascendens plectri is fused with the crista parotica.</div>

<div class="ind2em">10.&nbsp;The pseudobasal process is fused to the otic capsule.</div>

<div class="ind2em">11.&nbsp;The cornu principalis of the hyale fuses with the pseudobasal
process.</div>

<div class="ind2em">12.&nbsp;Two acoustic foramina are present.</div>

<div class="ind2em">13.&nbsp;The sphenethmoid and prootic are synchondrotically united.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span></div>

<div class="ind2em">14.&nbsp;The frontoparietal is separate from the prootic and exoccipital.</div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
